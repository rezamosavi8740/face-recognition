## Overview

This document provides detailed instructions on how to access and use the pre-trained models for the CVLFace. 
Our models are available for both google drive and via HuggingFace.

## Accessing Models

### Download from Google Drive (for research code usage)

For users who prefer to work directly with the model files, we have made our pre-trained models available through Google Drive. Please follow the steps below to download and set up the models in your local environment:

1. **Download Models:**
   - Visit our Google Drive folder: [CVLFace Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HoCDPRc-6J1xPDViIWleks_fn3FUUdrq?usp=drive_link)
   - Download the required model files.

2. **Installation:**
   - Place the downloaded models into the respective directories in your local clone of the CVLFace repository:
     - `cvlface/pretrained_models/recognition` for recognition models.
     - `cvlface/pretrained_models/alignment` for alignment models.

### Using HuggingFace (for standalone model usage)

For users who simply want to use the model right away in their own task, follow the instructions in our [pretrained_models/README.md](cvlface/pretrained_models/README.md) on the Hugging Face Hub. This document provides detailed guidance on how to utilize our models directly within your applications.
