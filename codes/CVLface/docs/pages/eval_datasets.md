### Overview
It is an instruction on how to download and set up the evaluation toolkit required for assessing face recognition models using CVLFace. The toolkit is needed for evaluating models during training or after training. 

### Downloading the Evaluation Toolkit
To access the evaluation toolkit:

1. **Download the Toolkit**: Click on this externally hosted [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NSjSs__RlgJjGPJTWCY9EzTJUx-WRuaq/view?usp=sharing) to download the evaluation toolkit zip file.

2. **Setup Instructions**: After downloading, decompress the zip file into the designated directory specified by `$DATA_ROOT` in your `.env` file. The expected directory structure should be `$DATA_ROOT/facerec_val`.


### Accessing the Password for the Zip File
The toolkit is hosted externally and we manage the distribution of the password to the zip file. 
To obtain the password, please fill out the required form available at [form link](https://forms.gle/qEuXMbLA4f8tkEbg9). Upon submission, the password will be shared with you to access the toolkit.

The toolkit contains the derivatives of the validation datasets such as aligned images and labels. 
Do not re-distribute the password or the unzipped version of the toolkit. It is released for encouraging reproducibility of research. 
But if it infringes the copy-right of the original datasets, the password may be retracted.
